# Task </br>
To open another website inside our web-app on button click.</br>

# Outcome </br>
--> The alternative method to embed the content from the external website. For example, you can use a proxy server to retrieve the content from the external website on your server-side code and then serve it to your own website. This way, the content is not being loaded within a frame or iframe, so the X-Frame-Options header does not apply.</br>

# Observations </br>
--> We can't access the website in Iframe if the X-Frame-options is set to DENY.</br>
--> We can use iFrame Allow extension to open any website in our localhost iframe. (temp. work around).</br>

# Limitation </br>
--> While embeding the content from website, it was only rendering the Html, and not the Css and Assets.
